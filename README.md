### Interacting with the Website

Upon opening the application, you will be greeted with the dashboard displaying the list of inventory items. Here's how you can interact with the website:

- **View Inventory Items**: Scroll through the list of existing inventory items to get an overview of what's currently in stock.
  
- **Add New Item**: Click on the "Add New Item" button to add a new inventory item. You'll be presented with a form where you can input details such as item name, description, quantity, and price. Fill out the required details and click "Save" to add the item to the inventory.

- **Update Item**: To modify an existing inventory item, click on the edit icon next to the item you want to update. This will open a form pre-populated with the item's current details. Make the necessary changes and click "Save" to update the item.

- **Delete Item**: If you need to remove an item from the inventory, simply click on the delete icon next to the item you wish to delete. Confirm the action, and the item will be permanently removed from the system.
